     const firebaseConfig = {
         apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
         authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
         projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
         storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
         messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
         appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     };

     export const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
     ```

3. **Deploy the app to Vercel:**
   - Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
   - Connect the repository and click **Deploy**.
